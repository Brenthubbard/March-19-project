  <div>
    <p>
      I was born in Sandpoint Idaho which is in the northern panhandle. I did construction through my 20's. in my late
      20's I went to college. I dropped out when I was a sophomore. I went back 5 or so years later to finish with a
      bachelors degree in business. After college I moved to Portland Oregon and went into finance. I did this for 3 or
      so years until I realized it was not a good fit for me. I did 2 years at a building company until I was offerd the
      chance to help with a crypto currency coin. I thought that sounded like a great oportunity so I moved back to
      Idaho to begin working on this project. I was tasked with helping with ideas and bringing it to market. This
      proved difficult due to regulatory constraints. This is what brought me to my current endevor. I enjoyed mining
      the coin so much I decided to look into the coding and decided I really enjoy it and am mnow heading in the
      developer direction.
